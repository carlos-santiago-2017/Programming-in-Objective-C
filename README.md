Objective-C-Projects
====================

This is my attempt to do the exercises which are at the back of every
chapter in the book "Programming in Objective-C", by Stephen G. Kochan.

Some content, namely "Happiness" and "Psychologist", are also taken from
Stanford's CS193p Fall 2011 course that is offered through iTunes U.
